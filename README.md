So, I think that I set up my table correctly for mySQL, but it doesn't seem to be rendering properly.  I looked online over and over, trying to figure out how to get it to "write" my table to the terminal using node... but didn't really understand how to get that done.  

Setting up the inquirer should't be too hard, but there would need to be a function which updates the quantity of items remaining in inventory dynamically after the user indicates which product they would like to purchase and in what quantity.  

I'm not going to lie.  I'm pretty unsatisfied with the program at this point.  I really dislike the way it is structured, where you basically get new concepts thrown at you for a couple of hours a week, and then are "released into the wild" to try to figure out how to actually do those things which were shown to you and that you attempted to do and probably didn't succeed at.  I don't understand the point of it.  I know that I don't know how to code.  I want someone who DOES know how to help me learn it. I don't enjoy spending hours trying to fiddle with code, just trying to make it work, or hours spent reading about code, trying to figure out how to get it to work.  

I would honestly rather spend my time just working through exercises on CodeAcademy or something like that, since they at least help you actually complete the exercise.  They give you hints and explain why it isn't working and then why it does work.  

I hate that we have homework, because then I spend all my time just trying to figure out how to do the homework, and if I can't figure it out, or only figure it out partially, I feel like I've wasted a ton of my time.  It doesn't motivate me to spend hours failing, without any certainty that I will ever succeed.  

I hate that we get assigned homework before we have even been exposed to all the information which we need in order to complete the homework, which basically means we can't do it until a day or few days before it is due.  I don't understand why we don't get assigned a set of exercises to complete before the next class, then go over those exercises in class, then go on to new material.  This is basically what every normal type of class does.  

I don't understand why there isn't an option for less experienced/skilled/knowledgeable students to just do a set of assigned exercises in lue of some extensive homework assignment which might be beyond their skillsets or abilities, or would require too much of a time investment for them to be able to complete.  Or, much smaller, more conservative assignments, with step by step instructions on how to complete them and explanations of what is actually going on.  

I had drill from Friday morning to Sunday night, and was unable to work on my homework that entire time frame.  I also had a further commitment with my unit from 0700-1900 on Wednesday.  So, I basically had Monday, Tuesday and today to work on this assignment.  I did a git pull, and couldn't even find all the solutions to the SQL exercises... which are pretty much required to complete this homework.  So... yeah.  

In 2 more weeks (the weekend of November 10th-12th), I have drill again.  That means for whatever that homework is, I'm going to be faced with another scenario where I have 3 less days to work on the assignment, have to spend 4 hours on Monday watching the video to get caught up, and only have a few days to complete it.  So basically, even if I can get caught up again and figure out what is going on, that is going to help to ensure that I get thrown behind again.
